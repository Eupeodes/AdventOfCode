My code for Advent of Code. The `.txt` files referenced contain the input given by Advent of Code, I have decided to exclude those from this repo as the data is available at https://adventofcode.com. To get the data from Advent of Code run `bin/console init <year> <day>`, to run you solution run `bin/console run <year> <day>`

For the scripts to work you need to store the value of the cookie named `session` in the file `cookie.txt` in the root directory (the same directory where README.md is located).

Ow, and the easy way to get rid of all my solutions while maintaining the other code is `rm AdventOfCode/Y*`.
